# Welcome to AdvantageScope!

AdvantageScope is a cross-platform data visualization and log review tool for
FIRST Robotics Competition teams.  It reads logs in WPILOG and RLOG formats and
can view live robot data through Network Tables 4 (NT4).

Supported visualization tools include:
- A wide selection of flexible graphs and charts
- 2D and 3D field visualizations of odometry data, with customizable CAD-based robot avatars
- Synchronized video playback from a separately loaded match video
- Controller use, showing driver/operator actions on customizable controller representations
- Swerve drive module vector displays
- Console message review
- Log statistics

Windows, Mac, and Linux binaries are provided.

AdvantageScope does not require AdvantageKit; although they were designed to
work well together, AdvantageScope is an independent tool that can be used by
any team through WPILOG and NT4 based data.
