The auto-update system has received an overhaul, bringing a few improvements:
* The download button now links directly to the relevant asset on GitHub, matching the current platform and architecture.
* The messages no longer include the most recent changelog (this feature was confusing when incrementing multiple versions).
* All prompts are now more consistent with the rest of the app.
* Detection of a translated environment on macOS and Winodws is now integrated into the update checker.
