Minor bug fixes/improvements:
* Continuous line graph data no longer intersects with discrete data.
* When restoring a line graph with locked axes, their status is now displayed properly on the axis titles.
* Replacing a missing field in the odometry config now correctly removes the strikethrough effect.
* (Experimental) The odometry timeline now properly updates when receiving live log data.
