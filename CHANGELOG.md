Live logging is now available! More testing is still required, but the feature is currently in a working state for most use cases. A few other features come along for the ride...
* There's a new preferences window, used to set the address and port for live logging.
* Auto zoom on the line graph when connected live is now more reliable and less annoying.
* The runtime indicator in the sidebar updates more consistently.
* The edit menu is back! Copy and paste fans rejoice!
