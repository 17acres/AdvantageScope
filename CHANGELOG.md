Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements:
* Fixed the filename displayed in the confirmation dialog for opening a log after a download on Windows.
* Improved handling of live logging state, including displaying more information in the title bar and detecting timeouts.
* Fixed an issue causing the selected time on the odometry timeline to jump erratically.
* Added the ability to hide the side bar (useful for running split screen with odometry).
* Added error handling when viewing data without an "Enabled" field.
* Fixed an issue causing the robot trail on the odometry tab to render incorrectly when live.
* The selection is now automatically locked when starting live mode.
* When editing axes manually, the min and max values are now rounded to five decimal places.
